# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Architecture Type 1 - Replaces Data

Table: CustomerAddress

CustomerID (Foreign Key)
StreetAddress
City
State
PostalCode


Architecture Type 2 - Replaces data
Table: CustomerAddress

CustomerAddressID (Primary Key)
CustomerID (Foreign Key)
StreetAddress
City
State
PostalCode
StartDate (When this address became valid)
EndDate (When this address was superseded)
IsCurrent (Boolean to indicate current address)

A new row/data is added each time there is a change of address, with StartDate and EndDate fields to track the period during which each address was valid. This will keep record of all changes. Although this will come with come privacy implications as greater volume of data storage presents with greater exposure threat to unauthourized users. More data requires more protections.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
1)My ERD is simplistic, as if the managment was under one peron. However AdventureWorks Schema is built for multiple departments (multiple users) HR, Purchasing etc. It is more complex. 

2)In my ERD the a single table is used for multiple applications. Address and contact info is in the same table for the bookstore ERD, but broken down into small tables for AdventureWorks possibly to avoid unnecessary exposure of private data for unauthorized users.
