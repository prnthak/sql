**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my role as a research assistant, where I support graduate students and operate analytical instruments that record fluorescence data from cellular markers, it is essential to integrate ethical considerations and address inequities within our research practices.

Ethically, it is imperative to ensure that all data collected and analyzed is done so with the utmost integrity. One specific area of concern is the sensitivity settings of the detectors used in fluorescence measurements. Altering the sensitivity between samples can lead to inconsistent data, which compromises the validity of the research findings. To prevent this, I would implement standardized procedures for calibrating and operating the instruments. This includes routine checks and calibrations before each use, and thorough training for all team members on the importance of maintaining consistent detector settings throughout an experiment. Ensuring ethical data management is crucial to maintaining the credibility and reliability of our research.

Addressing inequity involves ensuring fair access to resources and opportunities for professional development. As providers of service, we often get approached by vendors offering samples and discounts to promote their products. While these offers can be beneficial, it is vital to distribute these resources equitably among all team members. To achieve this, I would ensure that grants are in place to manage and distribute resources fairly. This involves setting up transparent criteria for the allocation of samples and discounts, ensuring that all students, regardless of their background or seniority, have equal opportunities to benefit from these resources.
